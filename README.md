PURPOSE:

There are currently not many accessible and/or adequate online tools for determining the potential quality of stargazing on a given night in a given location. 

As someone who likes to stargaze, I wanted to create some easy-to-use tools for myself, and potentially others, to be able to quickly determine stargazing potential for a given night.

METHODS:

Here, I use a combination of Python and SQL to return a rating, as well as some supplemental information, regarding stargazing potential on a given night given a particular location. 

This may not be the most efficient method of accomplishing this task and so, in the StargazingV2 repo, I have a second version which does the above in one Python script.
